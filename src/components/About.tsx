        Satoshi Tajiri—who later founded Game Freak—conceived the premise of
        Pokémon in general in 1989, when the Game Boy was released. The
        creatures that inhabit the world of Pokémon are also called Pokémon.[1]
        The word "Pokémon" is a romanized contraction of the Japanese brand
        Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā).[2] The concept of
        the Pokémon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional
        world of Pokémon, stems most notably from Tajiri's childhood hobby of
        insect collecting. Other influences on the concept include Ultraman,
        anime and playing video games in general. Throughout his early life,
        Tajiri saw his rural, nature-filled hometown (Machida, Tokyo) transform
        into an urban center. The urbanization of his town drove away wildlife
        and he and others living in the area were eventually unable to collect
        insects. Through Pokémon, Tajiri sought to bring back this outdoor
        pastime and share it with the world.[1] The first games in the
        franchise, Red and Green, were released on 27 February 1996 in Japan for
        the Game Boy.[3] The games were internationally released as Red and Blue
        in September 1998.[4] The ability to capture, battle, trade and care for
        numerous creatures catapulted Pokémon to international popularity,[2]
        and it has become a multibillion-dollar franchise and the second-best
        selling video game series after the Mario franchise.[5] At the start of
        a main series Pokémon game, the player character receives one of three
        "starter" Pokémon, with which they can battle and catch other Pokémon.
        Each Pokémon has one or two "types", such as Fire, Water, or Grass. In
        battle, certain types are strong against other types. For example, a
        Fire-type attack will do more damage to a Grass-type Pokémon—rather than
        a Water-type attack.[6] This form of gameplay is frequently compared to
        that of rock-paper-scissors, though players have to strategize which
        Pokémon and which of their attacks to use against various
        opponents.[7][8] Many species of Pokémon can evolve into a larger and
        more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat
        changes—generally a modest increase—and access to a wider variety of
        attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution, including
        reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a
        specific attack. For example, at level 16, Bulbasaur can evolve into
        Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee can evolve into eight
        different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water),
        Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice) and
        Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, the games introduced a new mechanic
        called Mega Evolution, as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called
        Primal Reversion. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal
        Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon
        reverting to its normal form at the end. 48 Pokémon can undergo Mega
        Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In
        contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown and Lycanroc
        undergo form changes, which may provide stat buffs or changes and type
        alterations but are not considered new species. Some Pokémon have
        differences in appearance due to gender. Pokémon can be male or female,
        male-only, female-only, or of an unknown gender.[9] The Pokémon
        franchise is primarily intended for younger players. However, each
        Pokémon has various complex attributes such as natures, characteristic
        traits, Individual Values (IVs) and Effort Values (EVs). These are
        intended for people "who enjoy battling and want to go more in depth",
        according to Game Freak Board Director Junichi Masuda. These individual
        statistics were also included, because the basic concept of the
        franchise is to train one's Pokémon. Designer Takeshi Kawachimaru stated
        that IVs and EVs "help to make each Pokemon in the game individual", as
        it adds unique aspects to them.[10] Each Pokémon game introduces a few
        "Legendary" and "Mythical" Pokémon that are powerful, rare and hard to
        catch.[11] Pokémon Sun and Moon introduced "Ultra Beasts", which are
        described as "beings from another dimension" that appeared in the Alola
        region and are similarly powerful and rare.[12]
