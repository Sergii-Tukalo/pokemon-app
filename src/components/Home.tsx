        The Pokémon franchise revolves around 1,015 fictional species of
        collectible monsters, each having unique designs, skills and powers.
        Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon are fictional
        creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The designs for the
        multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything such as animals,
        plants and mythological creatures. Many Pokémon are capable of evolving
        into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and
        achieve similar results. Originally, only a handful of artists led by
        Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon. However, by 2013 a team of 20 artists
        worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu
        Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. The vast array of
        creatures is commonly divided into "Generations", with each division
        primarily encompassing new titles in the main video game series and
        often a change of handheld platform. Generation I refers to Red, Green,
        Blue and Yellow; Generation II refers to Gold, Silver and Crystal;
        Generation III refers to Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen and Emerald;
        Generation IV refers to Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold and
        SoulSilver; Generation V refers to Black, White, Black 2 and White 2;
        Generation VI refers to X, Y, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire; Generation
        VII refers to Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon, Let's Go, Pikachu! and
        Let's Go, Eevee!; Generation VIII refers to Sword, Shield, Brilliant
        Diamond, Shining Pearl and Legends: Arceus; and Generation IX refers to
        Scarlet and Violet. Each Generation is also marked by the addition of
        new Pokémon: 151 in Generation I in the Kanto region, 100 in Generation
        II in the Johto region, 135 in Generation III in the Hoenn region, 107
        in Generation IV in the Sinnoh region, 156 in Generation V in the Unova
        region, 72 in Generation VI in the Kalos region, 88 in Generation VII in
        the Alola and Kanto regions, 96 in Generation VIII in the Galar and
        Hisui regions and 110 in Generation IX in the Paldea region. Due to the
        large number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into
        articles by generation. The 1015 Pokémon are organized by their number
        in the National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides
        various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into
        regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species introduced at the
        time of their respective generations along with older generations. For
        example, the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the 100 species
        introduced in Gold and Silver in addition to the original 151 species.
        The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed
        first, followed by species obtainable early in the respective games and
        are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. Generation V is a
        notable exception, as Victini is the first Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex.
